# WatchOS_Book_Projects
WachOS projects based upon Hacking with WatchOS book from Paul Hudson. The book details can be found here:

The repo will contain multiple projects. Though they reflect the practice projects, they will be tailored with my own personal tweaks as desired.


Note - For Project 4, an API Key is required. The Project is configured such that the user must create their own OER-Info.plist to work with the project. The project is also configured such that a sample plist file is used at compile time so as to run the project, that will also help guide the user in knowing what is needed for their own API Key plist.
